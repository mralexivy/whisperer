## App Store Description

```
Whisperer is a fast, completely offline voice-to-text app for macOS. Record voice memos, transcribe audio, and dictate text — all processed locally on your Mac. Nothing ever leaves your device.

THREE WAYS TO USE

1. Quick Transcription
Click the menu bar icon, tap record, and speak. Your transcription appears instantly — copy it anywhere you need.

2. Voice Memo & History
Record longer passages and review them later in the Workspace. Every transcription is saved with audio playback, word count, and language metadata.

3. System-Wide Dictation (Optional)
Hold the Fn key in any app — Notes, Slack, VS Code, Safari — speak naturally, and release. Your transcribed text appears at the cursor. Enable this optional feature during onboarding or later in Settings.

100% PRIVATE & OFFLINE
All transcription runs locally on your Mac using whisper.cpp, a high-performance open-source speech recognition engine. Your voice never leaves your device. No cloud processing, no accounts, no subscriptions.

APPLE SILICON OPTIMIZED
Built for speed with Metal GPU acceleration. The recommended Large V3 Turbo model delivers exceptional accuracy with real-time transcription on Apple Silicon Macs.

LIVE PREVIEW
Watch your words appear as you speak with streaming transcription. A floating overlay shows your audio waveform and progress in real time.

# Planning & Execution

## Active Plans

See [docs/exec-plans/](docs/exec-plans/) for active and completed execution plans.

## Tech Debt

Tracked in [docs/exec-plans/tech-debt.md](docs/exec-plans/tech-debt.md).

## Planning Process

1. Feature proposals start as GitHub issues or discussions
2. Complex features get design docs in [docs/design-docs/](docs/design-docs/)
3. Execution plans go in [docs/exec-plans/](docs/exec-plans/) with clear acceptance criteria
4. Completed plans are marked as such but retained for reference

## Current Focus Areas

- App Store submission preparation
- Workspace window polish and UX refinement
- Dictionary & spell correction accuracy
